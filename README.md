## internship project - osf july 2022

The project is an e-commerce website that has 4 pages named Index, Category Landing, Product Detail and 404 Error page. Each of them has some specifications like carousel banners, cards, hovers, sliders or preview buttons. 

I needed to develop the project according to the Functional Specification Document (FSD) that contains these project needs explanations in detail.
Also, there are some PSD files in the project detail file and I needed to get the images from these PSD files. I used FIGPEA (https://figpea.com/) to get images from the PSD files.
